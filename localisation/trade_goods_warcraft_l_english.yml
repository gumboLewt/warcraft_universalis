In fact, elementium isn’t native to Azeroth and is found only near high concentrations of elemental creatures because they bring it from the Elemental Plane where it is actually quite common. The unique properties of elementium allow it to absorb and channel elemental forces. Skilled smiths temper elementium in blistering forges, adding to the quality of the item. Elementium is so heavy that to craft armour from it would leave the wearer virtually immobile, so the metal is usually only used to craft weapons."
